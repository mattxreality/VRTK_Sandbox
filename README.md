# VRTK_Sandbox
Learning the VRTK platform, in order to create rapid VR prototypes.

<b>Description:</b>
This repository holds a Unity project with the VRTK v3.3.0, Oculus Integration, LWRP, and ProBuilder as the foundational packages and functionalities. 

My intention is to create a Unity project that will serve as a template for rapid prototyping of Oculus Rift VR experiences using the aforementioned assets and packages.
